# TuneTap Game Rules

## Objective
Be the first player to correctly place 10 songs in your timeline.

## Setup
The game begins with each player's timeline having one starting song.

## Gameplay
On each turn, you will be presented with a new song. Your goal is to place this song into the correct chronological position within your personal timeline, based on its original release date.

## Scoring
- **Correct Placement**: If you place the song in the correct spot, it will be added to your timeline, and your score will increase by 1 point.
- **Incorrect Placement**: If you place the song incorrectly, your turn ends. The song is discarded for that turn, and your score does not change.

## Winning the Game
The first player to accumulate 10 points by correctly placing 10 songs wins the game!

## Track Pool
Each song from the playlist will only appear once during a game. If the game runs out of available tracks before a player wins, the game will end. You will need to start a new game with a larger playlist to ensure there are enough unique songs.
